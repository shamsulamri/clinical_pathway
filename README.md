## Clinical Pathway

Many years ago I came across a win32 application with a unique feature that i was so impresssed. It is a clincal application with a superb method of entering clinical notes. I couldn't find or buy the application anywhere online at the time but I took a lot of screenshot of how the process works. It uses a structured information or clinical pathway to enter data and most importantly it was easy and friendly. After many years and still couldn't find any similar application I decided to create one. However the solution is a web application and I had to make design changes but the main process is still similar.

The source is still in development but operational. Have fun, stay safe.
