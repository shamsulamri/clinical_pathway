## Clinical Pathway

Many years ago I came across a win32 application with a unique feature that i was so impresssed. It is a clincal application with a superb method of entering clinical notes. I couldn't find or buy the application anywhere online at the time but took a lot of screenshot of how the process works. It uses a structured information or clinical pathway to enter data and most importantly it was easy and friendly. After many years and yet still couldn't find any similar application I decided to create one. Unlike the original, this is a web application with many design changes to accomodate the web. However the idea remains the same. 

The source is still in early development but operational. 

Have fun, stay safe.
